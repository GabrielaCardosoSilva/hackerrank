'''Task
Write a Person class with an instance variable age and a constructor that takes an integer iniialAge, as a parameter. The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should set age to 0 and print 'Age is not valid, setting age to 0.' In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

1. yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1.
2. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
    If age < 13, print You are young.
    If age >= 13 and age < 18, print You are a teenager.
    Otherwise, print You are old.'''

class Person:
    def __init__(self, initialAge):
        if initialAge < 0:
            self.age = 0
            print("Age is not valid, setting age to 0.")
        else: 
            self.age = initialAge
        
    def amIOld(self):
        if self.age < 13:
            print("You are young.")
        elif self.age >= 13 and self.age < 18:
            print("Your are a teenager.")
        else:
            print("You are old.")
